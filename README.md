Introduction
============
Welcome to my small virtual world. 
I am atronah (yes, this word is from _TES III: Morrowind_), 
and I am programmer or something like this.

This git project intends to collect all about my others projects and useful (at least for me) technical info in one place. 
You can consider it as a hall of my programming world.
