(need check, has written from memory)

```
function foo(single_param) {
    return 123
}
```

can be written as unnamed function

```
(single_param) => {
    return 123
}
```

and for single parameter it can be written as

```
single_param => {
    return 123
}
```

or just 

```
single_param => 123
}
```
