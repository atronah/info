### archive of folder with\without folder name in root

- `7z a archive_name.7z "folder_name"` - makes archive `archive_name.7z` which contains `folder_name` in root
- `7z a archive_name.7z "./folder_name/*"` - makes archive `archive_name.7z` which contains files `folder_name` in root.
Notes: `*` must be escape (`\*`) in bash-scripts


### CLI command for `fastest` LZMA2 compression

([source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39914398/7zip-fastest-lzma2-compression))

```
7z a -t7z -m0=LZMA2:d64k:fb32 -ms=8m -mmt=30 -mx=1 -- archive_name.7z source
```

where

- `a` is the command Add.
- `-t7z` - sets the archive type to 7-Zip.
- `-m0=LZMA2:d64k:fb32` - defines the usage of LZMA2 compression method with a dictionary size of 64 KB and a word size (fast bytes) of 32
(`-m0` means `0` method in methods chain).
- `-ms=8m` - enables solid mode with a solid block size of 8 MB.
- `-mmt=30` - enables multi-threading mode with up to 30 threads.
- `-mx=1` - selects fastest compressing as level of compression.
- `--` - stops parsing for other switches on rest of the command line.

or just `7z a -mx=1 -- archive_name.7z source` - using `1` level of compression
(from [7z help](https://sevenzip.osdn.jp/chm/cmdline/switches/method.htm) `1` level is `Fastest compressing` and using `LZMA2` Method, `64 KB` Dictionary, `32` FastBytes, `HC4` as MatchFinder, `BCJ` as Filter)
